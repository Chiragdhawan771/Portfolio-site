  aboutme: `A full-stack developer passionate about building smart, scalable, and user-centric digital experiences. I specialize in creating cross-platform mobile apps with React Native and robust backend systems using Node.js.

My work focuses on delivering real-time, high-performance applications, from crafting seamless UIs and optimizing performance to designing efficient APIs. I’ve also integrated AI-powered features, including pose detection using TensorFlow and AI-driven chatbots with voice interaction, enhancing modern apps with smarter and more interactive experiences.

I enjoy working with technologies like Express.js, MongoDB, and Firebase while continuously exploring new ways to make applications intuitive, efficient, and impactful.

Currently, I’m working on projects that merge mobility, intelligence, and real-time interactivity, pushing the boundaries of what apps can do.`,
